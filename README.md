### Using Multi-Agent Architecture + LangGraph + Vector Search + Local LLMs

## 🚀 Overview

It automatically:

✔ Processes raw financial news  
✔ Removes duplicate & redundant articles  
✔ Extracts market entities (companies, sectors, regulators)  
✔ Maps news to impacted stocks with confidence levels  
✔ Ranks news based on semantic relevance + entity impact  
✔ Allows natural-language queries  
✔ Summarizes articles + explains impact using a local LLM (Ollama)  
✔ Provides both API endpoints (FastAPI) and UI (Streamlit)  
✔ Uses LangGraph multi-agent architecture  

This system is built following the structure required for the hackathon challenge.
